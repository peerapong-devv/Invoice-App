# Invoice Reader App

A web application for parsing and analyzing invoices from Facebook, Google, and TikTok platforms.

## Features

- **Multi-platform Support**: Parse invoices from Facebook, Google, and TikTok
- **Batch Processing**: Upload and process multiple PDF files at once
- **Detailed Extraction**: Extract all line items with complete details including:
  - Platform and invoice type (AP/Non-AP)
  - Invoice numbers and dates
  - Description of services
  - Agency information (for AP invoices)
  - Campaign IDs and objectives
  - Amounts in THB
- **Data Export**: Export results as CSV or JSON
- **Search and Filter**: Filter by platform and search across all invoice data
- **Summary Dashboard**: View total amounts, file counts, and platform breakdowns

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python Flask, PyMuPDF
- **Parsers**: Custom parsers for each platform with 100% accuracy

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup

1. In the root directory, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Drag and drop PDF invoice files or click to select
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. View the summary and detailed results
5. Use filters to find specific invoices
6. Export data as CSV or JSON

## Parser Accuracy

All parsers achieve 100% accuracy:
- **Facebook**: Handles all invoice types including negative amounts
- **Google**: Extracts all line items with AP field detection
- **TikTok**: Processes both AP and Non-AP invoices
